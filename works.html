    <h2>Paintings</h2>

    <p>Through portraiture and depictions of space, my work revolves around personal explorations of internal struggles and identity. With the use of mixed media, acrylic and oil paint, I experiment with transparency, pattern and colour to create luminosity and a flow of movement in my paintings. I delve into intimate moments that I've shared with myself or loved ones, or simply compelling instances that tell a story and that I'm drawn to capture. My figures can appear detached from reality, see-through, and existing in dreamlike environments. Integrating specific rooms in my home in each work, they act as a platform for new ways of exploring the different surroundings that exist around me and the particular atmospheres that can emerge from each space. I desire for my work to be unsettling and perplexing, but at the same time induce a sense of relatability for the viewer.</p>
