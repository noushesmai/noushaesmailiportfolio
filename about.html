    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

    <p>As an inherently creative individual, I have dabbled in from many mediums and art forms throughout my <a href="#education">education</a> journey, such as photography, drawing, painting, and digital work. I am currently studying UX/UI Design at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, although my artistic journey began at Emily Carr University, where I earned my Bachelor in Fine Arts and developed my skills in the arts. While my foundation is in fine arts, I've always been drawn to the world of design, particularly how technology can enhance the user experience. Outside of my design work, I have a passion for sewing and making clothes, where I explore the tactile side of creativity and problem-solving. I'm excited to blend my diverse artistic background with my growing skills in digital design, always aiming to create work that is both visually striking and user-centered.</p>

    <p><strong>Painting Practice</strong></p>
    <p>My practice centers around acrylic and oil painting, often incorporating mixed media elements into my work. I tend to illustrate scenes of interior spaces, frequently depicting myself in my own home, while experimenting with perspective and psychological nuances. Through painting, I seek to make sense of my personal experiences of dissociation and disconnection from reality. I'm drawn to the ambiguous, the unsettling, and the alien, exploring these themes in my work. A significant aspect of my practice is reimagining the image of women in domestic spacesâ€”showing the female body existing peacefully and authentically within these environments. By portraying my own body at home, I aim to take control over what is shown and what is withheld, creating a space where I can own and understand my own reality.</p>
